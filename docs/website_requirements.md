# Green Musa Capital Website Requirements

## Overview
Green Musa Capital requires a modern, clean website that resonates with investors interested in ESG-focused value investing. The site should deliver an exceptional user experience across both mobile and desktop platforms, with compelling content that converts visitors to clients through strategic storytelling and valuable tools.

## Design Philosophy
- **Modern & Clean**: Contemporary design with ample white space and clear typography
- **Emotionally Engaging**: Visuals and copy that connect with the target audience's values
- **Conversion-Focused**: Strategic content flow that guides visitors toward consultation booking
- **Responsive**: Seamless experience across all devices with optimized layouts

## Color Palette
Maintain brand consistency by using Green Musa Capital's existing color scheme:

- **Primary Green**: The distinctive green from their logo (representing growth and sustainability)
- **Secondary Earthy Tones**: Complementary browns and neutrals that suggest stability and reliability
- **Accent White/Light Gray**: For clean backgrounds and readability
- **Text Colors**: Dark gray/near black for body text, with green highlights for emphasis
- **Call-to-Action Elements**: Use the primary green for buttons and important interactive elements

Note: The exact color hex codes should be extracted from the current website to ensure perfect brand matching. The green symbolizes both the 'Green' in their name and their focus on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing.
